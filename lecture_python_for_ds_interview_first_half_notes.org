** tough interview questions

use real example from the past


Q1. tell me about yourself

時間大概是一分鐘，前半講講過去事蹟，後半講述最近在做什麼或是有什麼事蹟值得講的

Q2. why are you leaving your current position

回答要正向，不要有抱怨，具有什麼目標性～ 想要成長


Q3. Why do you want this position

要表現得有自信，裡面最重要的

Q4. Where do you see yourself in 5 years

算是一種自我期許的問題，展現你的目標

Q5. What is your greatest weakness

雖然這題的答案不太會影響到公司對你的評價，但是還是得多少準備一下，通常是講講自己的缺點後，說明自己正在或如何改變這個缺點
說明這個缺點不會影響到工作！

Q6. What do you know about our company

這題證明了你事前對公司的調查，然後回答你可以對公司有什麼貢獻

Q7. What's the most difficult situation you had to face at a job

2 to 8, 20% for the situation and 80% for the solutions
重點在於你如何解決這個問題，不要多著墨於遇到的情況

Q8. What do you think makes a successful manager

講一些關於團隊合作的，可能會比較好

** special case questions

Q1. How do you explain the gaps that appeear in your resume

意思是指空窗期吧，為什麼會有這段時間

Q2. Why has it taken you so long to find work

其實跟前面意思很像，總之這邊要好好解釋

Q3. How many positions have you applied for

盡量不要說出精確的數字，要有所保留，你找太多間，就會被懷疑想要進入公司的目標性
